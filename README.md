# Admin_Dashboard
project files are mentioned in master directory

The primary purpose of this admin panel is to provide the administrator with the ability to perform various operations on the data without the need for page refreshes.

This project is an admin panel built using a combination of HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ajax, PHP, and MySQL technologies. 

The combination of these technologies allows the admin panel to perform various CRUD operations (Add, Update, Delete) on the data in the MySQL database. Additionally, with the use of Ajax, the admin can perform these operations without the need for page refreshes, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.

For example, when the admin adds a new record through a form, JavaScript can capture the form data and use Ajax to send the data to the PHP backend for validation and insertion into the database. Once the PHP script has completed the operation, it returns a response to JavaScript, which then updates the admin panel's content to reflect the changes.

Similarly, when the admin wants to update or delete an existing record, JavaScript can send the necessary data to PHP through Ajax, and PHP will execute the corresponding operation on the MySQL database. The updated data or confirmation of deletion is then sent back to JavaScript, and the admin panel is updated in real-time.

In summary, this admin panel leverages the power of these technologies to provide a smooth and dynamic user experience, allowing the admin to manage data efficiently without the need for constant page refreshes.
